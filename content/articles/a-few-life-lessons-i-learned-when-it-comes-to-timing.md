As I was at the stoplight waiting for the light to go from red to green, I was chilling, with my head bobbing to the song “Wait” by Maroon 5 with lyrics that went something like this:

> I’ll make up for all those times
>
> Your love, I don’t wanna lose
>
> I’m begging you
>
> Wait, can you turn around?

I was singing along to the song when I suddenly felt my chapped lips. I ever so slyly reached out for my lip balm in one of my jacket’s pockets on the floor of the passenger seat. I got to open the tube when suddenly the light turned green. Ugh.

Thanks to my unsuccessful attempt of putting on lip balm and listening to Adam Levine’s qualms about lost time with a past lover, I realized how much the concept of time does not “wait” for you because it doesn’t give a f*ck about you. Ironically, that is precisely why I like to wear watches. It reminds me that time is of the essence because it doesn’t give a f*ck about you.

The concept of timing has been a big theme in my life for the past two years. Whether it was good or the bad kind of timing, it has me brought me all kinds of lessons.

For one, I came here to the states on a student visa. After college, I was at liberty to work in the US for a year and then ultimately, had to go back home after my work permit expired. I had a great job. I was a project manager for a company.

A year passed, my work permit expired, and I had to go back home. Well, I chose not to. I figured out a way to stay — legally, which worked out in my favor in the end, but by law, I could not work for a year.

That one year did not do me any good. My life was put on pause. A year of my life slipped by just like that. I watched other people pursue their dreams, while my own had to be paused, be put on hold.

After that uphill battle of a year, which is at present, I finally won. I am able to work again. Unfortunately for me, my new battle is starting from the bottom all over again. Because of time. Within that one year, I was not able to progress myself career-wise. Because time does not wait.

After countless sent resumes to companies, I found a decent company who called me back. I went through the first and second round of interviews, met with the HR manager and the director.

After which, they told me they would give me two days to think if I wanted the job or not. In my head and in any sane person’s head, that meant a job offer, right? Wrong. After I told them that I wanted the job, they told me that they would contact me in a week to let me know their decision. They never did. What. The. F$ck. I was told they would give me time to think if I wanted the job or not. And then dead silence.

I also learned that people do not give a f$ck about your time.

Another example of bad timing that I have experienced is people who have been in my life forever, all of a sudden coming out of the woodwork, blindsiding me and admitting to me out of nowhere that they had feelings for me this whole time.

Although flattering in a way, it ultimately caused more harm than anything because it just confused me and ended up hurting me. Too much time has also passed for me to be able to remotely do anything about it. I also learned that people do not understand the concept of time when it comes to love. Sometimes, it is just too late.

To answer Adam Levine’s question, “if we can wait, if we can turn it around,” sometimes the answer is no.

I can’t wait and turn around the year that I lost being able to work on myself, and furthering myself in my career. But instead, I can start over and keep moving forward until I get to where I want to be.

I can’t wait and turn around the wasted time with people who don’t give a f\*ck about my time. But instead, I can choose to not let them keep wasting it any further by letting go.

I can’t wait and turn around to see what it could have been like with so and so. But instead, I can just thank them for loving me/having loved me.

What else can I do instead, you ask?

Well, for now, I can wait for the stoplight to turn into a green light before I put my lip balm on. TC mark
